- The folder OPTIMISED_CASE contains 6 notebooks. Each notebook has two experiments, both have the same Learning Algorithm (SARSA or Q-Learning) and the same stochastic environment.
- Each notebook covers two different states.
- All the supporting python files are present in the OPTIMISED_CASE folder.
- Each notebook has 4 runs, 2 of epsilon-greedy, 2 of softmax.
-The folder BASE_CASE follows the exact same structure, except it uses untuned hyperparamters instead.
- Running Instructions : All required helper files are in the same folder. Just run the notebook!
